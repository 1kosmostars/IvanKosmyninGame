## Overview
IvanKosmyninGame is a conceptual abstraction of a game engine environment developed in Java. The project serves as a technical demonstration of architectural patterns, focusing on the decoupling of game logic, entity management, and state progression within a strictly object-oriented framework.

## Technical Architecture
The repository illustrates a modular approach to game development without reliance on external libraries or heavy frameworks. Key technical highlights include:
*   **Encapsulation:** Clear separation between data structures and behavioral logic.
*   **Abstraction Layer:** Implementation of high-level interfaces for game entities.
*   **Performance:** Optimized for minimal overhead using native Java SE capabilities.

## Requirements
*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 11 or higher.
*   **Environment:** Any standard terminal or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) supporting Java.

## Installation and Execution
To deploy and run the abstraction locally, execute the following commands:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com
